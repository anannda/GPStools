# GPStools -- collection of programs useful in GPS processing

As I started setting up my automated GPS processing I found I needed
a slew of new helper codes. They will slowly accumulate here. Much 
of this relates to preparing or maintaining input / aux files
for [JPL's GIPSY](https://gipsy-oasis.jpl.nasa.gov/). Though,
I am trying to keep this more general. IGS log parsing probably 
helpful for others, etc. 

Due to the nature of this project, it will likely be in flux until
I found what suits me best.
